                <p>
                    Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, 
                    algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.
                    Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large.
                    The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. 
                    As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, complex systems, 
                    communication and business.[7][8] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer interaction: users 
                    should be able to intuitively control and explore data. In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, 
                    statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.

           <h2>history of data science</h2>
          <p>
               In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called “data analysis,” which resembles modern data science.
               Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on 
               data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.
               The term “data science” has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for computer science.
               In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.
               However, the definition was still in flux. In 1997, C.F. Jeff Wu suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. 
               He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or 
               limited to describing data.[21] In 1998, Chikio Hayashi argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: 
               data design, collection, and analysis.
